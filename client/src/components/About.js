                    <p>As a wee lad, there was one thing that little Strauss enjoyed above all--climbing. A tree or a jungle gym became a challenge. He saw simple problems that had simple solutions. He made it his goal to find the most efficient way from point A on the ground to point B in the sky. </p>
